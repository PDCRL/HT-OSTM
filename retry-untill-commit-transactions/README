Contains the IITH RWSTM test application and OSTM test application to test the OSTM developed as my Master's thesis project at IIT Hyderabad. The transaction types are the ones which keep on retrying untill they succeed.

The test application is a hash table with following operations:
	1) insert	: inserts a key into hash table
	2) delete	: deletes a key from hash table
	3) lookup	: finds a given key from hash table.
	4) move		: deletes a random key and inserts another random key to the hashtable.

The performance stats collected:
	1) number of aborts.
	2) time taken for all threads in milli seconds.

Stats collected are for 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 threads respectively. And averaged over 50 runs.
load distribution :
	40% of threads do insert.
	30% of threads do delete.
	20% of threads do lookup.
	10% of threads do move.
	
Each lookup threads does 4 lookup operations. Each insert threads does 4 insert operations. Each delete threads does 4 delete operations.

Hash table size is 5. The hash table is closed addressed.
